{"name":"Photon-HDF5","tagline":"A file format for freely-diffusing single-molecule experiments.","body":"### Welcome to Photon-HDF5 Project\r\n\r\n**Photon-HDF5** is a file format designed to store data from\r\nfreely-diffusing single-molecule spectroscopy experiments,\r\nsingle-molecule FRET (smFRET) (with or without lifetime), \r\nFluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)\r\nand related techniques.\r\n\r\nAny dataset containing photon timestamps and other per-photon data\r\ncan be stored using the Photon-HDF5 format.\r\nPhoton-HDF5 can store important experimental details\r\nand metadata (setup configurations, sample information, authorship and provenance)\r\nto make the file suitable for long-term preservation and data sharing.\r\n\r\nThe Photon-HDF5 format defines a conventional structure in HDF5 files for\r\na wide variety of timestamp-based single-molecule spectroscopy data.\r\nWe provide detailed format description, examples to read Photon-HDF5 in\r\nmultiple languages and a reference python library to create and convert \r\nPhoton-HDF5 files.\r\n\r\nPhoton-HDF5 project resources include:\r\n\r\n- [Photon-HDF5 Format Reference](http://photon-hdf5.readthedocs.org/)\r\n- [Reading Photon-HDF5 files in multiple languages](https://github.com/Photon-Data/photon_hdf5_reading_examples)\r\n- [phconvert](https://github.com/Photon-Data/phconvert): library to create and convert Photon-HDF5 files\r\n- [Photon-HDF5: an open format for single-molecule spectroscopy using photon-counting devices]() (*coming soon*)\r\n\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n- [Why an HDF5-based smFRET file format](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/HDF5_format.html)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
