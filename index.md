### Welcome to Photon-HDF5 Project

**Photon-HDF5** is a file format designed to store data from
freely-diffusing single-molecule spectroscopy experiments,
single-molecule FRET (smFRET) (with or without lifetime), 
Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)
and related techniques.

Any dataset containing photon timestamps and other per-photon data
can be stored using the Photon-HDF5 format.
Photon-HDF5 can store important experimental details
and metadata (setup configurations, sample information, authorship and provenance)
to make the file suitable for long-term preservation and data sharing.

The Photon-HDF5 format defines a conventional structure in HDF5 files for
a wide variety of timestamp-based single-molecule spectroscopy data.
We provide detailed format description, examples to read Photon-HDF5 in
multiple languages and a reference python library to create and convert 
Photon-HDF5 files.
